# A comment, this is so you can read your program later. (# is called a octothorpe or pound character)
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

# I am showing that a comment can be ignored if you put a # after the code.
print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a code:
# If you put a comment before the code then you can fully disable the code until you remove the comment
# print("This won't run.")

print("This won't run")

# I was right about the octothorpe and the # is indeed called the octothorpe
